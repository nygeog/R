This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library('tuneR')
 
sound <- sine(440, bit = 16)
 
writeWave(sound, '440.wav')

sound <- bind(sine(440, bit = 32),
              sine(880, bit = 32),
              sine(440, bit = 32) + sine(880, bit = 32)
 
sound <- normalize(sound, unit = '32')
 
writeWave(sound, 'octaves.wav')


source('interval.R')
 
base <- 440
 
sound <- sine(base) + sine(interval('minor-second',
                                    tuning = 'pythagorean') * base)
 
sound <- normalize(sound, unit = '32')
 
writeWave(sound, 'minor_second_pythagorean.wav')
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
